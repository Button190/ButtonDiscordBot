Wendy:

I'm making a webservice for myself.

Tristian talked about clicks being used to predict voting patterns - why not me use it to find out if I'm playing fortnite or working or watching a movie?

Are you in trouble with getting a name for your service? go absurdist and use a random word generator.

(shark tank style!) Apply your business model to homegyms where people are in need of gidance by professionals.

I tend to be weary of talking too much because eventually I start talking aboout very specific things of my interests and people don't understand and it's like a light just goes off in their head.


-- also it's ok that you listed me under your company.


oda loop.

we all build castles in the sand, but it is very frustrating and unpleasent when the water comes and takes away the unfinished castle with which we were still activelly engaged.
